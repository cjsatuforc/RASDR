# DigiRED Driver Releases

The RASDR project gratefully acknowledges Cypress Semiconductor Corporation for enabling the development of the RASDR Firmware and Windows Support (*).

The directory structure for the driver files is as follows:

      license.txt                - Cypress Semiconductor License Agreement
      README.md                  - This file
      docs/                      - screenshots and installation aids
      win7/                      - Windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit) driver files
      wlh/                       - Windows Vista driver files
      wxp/                       - Windows XP (32-bit only) driver files

Ensure that you have unzipped these files to your local hard drive, and plug in your DigiRED board.  When the Windows device installer prompts you, provide the folder to the correct one for your OS (Windows 7, Vista or Windows XP) as described above.  You should see roughly what is described in the screenshots in the docs/.
